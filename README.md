pre-commit example
The pre-commit framework bills itself as "A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks." Under the hood, it runs on python, but you can use the framework on any project, regardless of your project's primary language. Once installed, you're going to add a pre-commit configuration file to your project root named .pre-commit-config.yaml. In that config file, you will specify which scripts pre-commit will run when your pre-commit hook is triggered by a git commit command. Additionally, you can run the pre-commit scripts any time outside of a git commit call -- more on that later. The configuration file will look something like this (example taken from the pre-commit documentation):
